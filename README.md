# Welcome to my GitHub

My name is Jordan Mitchell. As of this past Spring, I am a certified Full Stack Developer. This repository contains my completed projects and work from the Georgia Tech Boot Camp Program. Posted below, you will find some quick demos of these projects. Please feel free to reach out to my email below with any offers, as I am currently seeking employment.
Thank you in advance for your time and consideration!
